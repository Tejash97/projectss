# Welcome to My Data Science Journey! 🚀
## About Me
Hey there! I'm Tejash Mishra, a second-year data science enthusiast on a mission to turn data into insights. I study at Techno India University, and this GitHub repository is my playground where I experiment, learn, and showcase what I can do with code and data.

# 🚀 Cool Projects Inside
### HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION MODEL
What's this about? A project where I A project where I built a robust House Price Predictor! It's my solution to the real-world challenge of estimating house prices using the power of data. It's my way of tackling real-world problems using Machine learning algorithm[Linear Regression].

Where's the Code? Right here: [Link to Code].
